.SH NAME
libssh2_session_set_channel_window_size - get default channel window size for new channels
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

unsigned long
libssh2_session_set_channel_window_size(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned long size);

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function sets the window size used as the default when new
channels created over the given session are initialized.

The window size determines the maximum amount of data that can be
flying from the server to the client at any moment, without being
acknowledged by the client, before the channel blocks.

A value too small limits the throughput of the channel. A value too
big will waste the client memory in useless buffers.

As of version 1.4.4 of libssh2 the default window size value
(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_WINDOW_DEFAULT) is 2MB which, in our opinion,
represents a good compromise between transfer speed and memory usage
for today real-life networks.

Note that every channel has its own window/buffers. Also, if
compression is enabled, additional memory would be wasted due to the
impossibility to accurately predict the size of the inflated packets a
priori.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the new default channel window size.

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function has been available since version 1.4.4.
